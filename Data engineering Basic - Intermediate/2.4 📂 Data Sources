# **Data Sources 1️⃣** 

---

Data sources have become more dynamic and versatile than ever before. Here are some common sources of data used in a data engineer's work:

---

### **Relational Databases 🔧**

- **Examples**: SQL Server, Oracle, MySQL, IBM DB2
- Used to store data in a structured way and can serve as a source for analysis. For example, data from a retail transaction system can be used to analyze sales across different regions.

---

### **Flat Files 📂**

- Flat files store data in a plain text format where each line represents a record, and each value is separated by delimiters such as commas or tabs.
- **Examples**: CSV and TSV
- These files can be mapped to a single table, in contrast to relational databases, which use multiple tables.

---

### **Spreadsheet Files 📊**

- Spreadsheets are a type of flat file that organizes data in a tabular format with rows and columns.
- **Examples**: Microsoft Excel, Google Sheets
- These files may also contain additional features like formulas and formatting. Spreadsheets can include multiple tabs that can be mapped to different tables.

---

### **XML (Extensible Markup Language) 📝**

- XML files store data using tags and can handle more complex data structures, such as hierarchical structures.
- **Use case**: Online surveys, account statements, and other types of semi-structured data.

---

### **APIs and Web Services 🌐**

- APIs (Application Programming Interfaces) and web services allow applications to interact and retrieve data for processing or analysis.
- **Examples**: Twitter API, Facebook API, stock market APIs
- APIs are used to fetch data in various formats, including JSON, XML, and HTML.

---

### **Web Scraping 🕸️**

- Web scraping is used to extract data from web pages based on defined parameters, such as contact information or product data from e-commerce websites.
- **Popular Tools**: BeautifulSoup, Scrapy, Pandas, Selenium

---

### **Data Streams 📈**

- Data streams are continuous flows of data from sources such as IoT devices, GPS, social media, and more.
- **Examples**: Stock market data, surveillance streams, social media feeds
- Popular tools for processing data streams: Apache Kafka, Apache Spark Streaming, Apache Storm

---

### **RSS Feeds 🔄**

- RSS feeds are used to capture updated data from online forums and news sites and stream it to users in real-time.

---

This variety of data sources enables the analysis and processing of data from a wide range of domains, requiring data engineers to master various technologies and tools.
