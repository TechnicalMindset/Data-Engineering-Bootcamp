📚 What is data?
Data is unorganized information that is processed to become meaningful. It can be:

Facts and observations 🧾
Numbers and symbols 🔢
Images and multimedia 🎨

⚙️ Three main data structures
1️⃣ Structured data

Definition: Data that is organized in a predefined format, such as tables with rows and columns.
Examples:
Excel spreadsheets 📊
SQL databases 🗄️
Online forms 📥

2️⃣ Unstructured data

Definition: Data without a specific format or organization.
Examples:
Text files (documents in free form) 📄
Media files (images, sound, video) 🎥
Social content (posts, tweets) 📱

3️⃣ Semi-structured data

Definition: Data with some organization, often in hierarchical structures or with tags.
Examples:
JSON files 🗂️
XML documents 💾
Emails 📧

🔧 Common file formats for data storage and transfer
Delimited text files: CSV, TSV 📑
Spreadsheets: Excel format 📋
Language files: JSON, XML 🌐

🏢 Data storage solutions
1️⃣ Relational databases (RDBMS)

Organized data in related tables.
Examples: MySQL, SQL Server, Oracle 🖥️
Use: OLTP systems for daily business transactions 💼

2️⃣ Non-relational databases

Flexible handling of unstructured and semi-structured data.
Examples: MongoDB, Cassandra, Redis 🌟

3️⃣ OLAP systems

Analysis of large datasets.
Use: Generate insights and forecasts 📊

✅ Questions to reinforce your understanding
Questions:
1️⃣ What is the difference between structured and unstructured data?
2️⃣ What are three examples of semi-structured data?
3️⃣ What are relational databases primarily used for?
4️⃣ Give examples of file formats for data storage and transfer.
5️⃣ How does OLAP differ from OLTP?

📝 Answers to the questions
1️⃣ The difference between structured and unstructured data:

Structured data is organized and follows a schema (e.g., tables in SQL).
Unstructured data has no specific format (e.g., images or text files).

2️⃣ Examples of semi-structured data:

JSON files 🗂️
XML documents 💾
Emails 📧

3️⃣ Relational databases are primarily used for:

Daily business transactions (OLTP), such as customer purchases and personnel management.

4️⃣ Examples of file formats:

CSV, TSV 📑
Excel 📋
JSON, XML 🌐

5️⃣ The difference between OLAP and OLTP:

OLAP: Analyzes large datasets for insights 📊.
OLTP: Manages daily transactions 💼.
