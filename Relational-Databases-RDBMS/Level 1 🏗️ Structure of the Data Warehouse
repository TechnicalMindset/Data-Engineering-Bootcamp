🏗️ Structure of the Data Warehouse
The data warehouse architecture is like a pipeline where data moves through several steps. This is what the structure looks like:

1️⃣ Data Sources
📌 What is it?
This is where everything starts! Data comes from different places:

Relational databases (e.g., MySQL, SQL Server).
File systems (e.g., CSV, JSON, log files).
APIs and third-party systems (e.g., Salesforce, Google Analytics).
📡 How is it used?
These sources provide raw data that needs to be processed before it can be used.

2️⃣ ETL/ELT Processes (Data Pipeline)
📌 What is it?
Data is cleaned, processed, and moved to the next step.

Extract: Retrieve data from the data sources.
Transform: Improve and clean the data, e.g., format dates, remove duplicates.
Load: Move the processed data to the warehouse.
⚙️ How does it connect?
The ETL process acts as a bridge between data sources and the storage system.

3️⃣ Staging Area
📌 What is it?
A temporary area where data is "parked" before it goes into the warehouse.

🗂️ How is it used?
Temporary storage to check data quality.
Sorting of data before it is moved forward.

🛤️ How is it connected?
It is connected between the ETL process and the data warehouse.

4️⃣ Data Warehouse
📌 What is it?
The main storage where all processed data is stored.

🏛️ How is it used?
Structured data is organized in tables, like in a relational database.
Data is ready to be used for analysis.

🗺️ How is it connected?
Receives data from the staging area.
Delivers data for analysis and reports.

5️⃣ Data Marts
📌 What is it?
Small portions of the data warehouse, created for specific purposes (e.g., sales, HR).

🛍️ How is it used?
Smaller datasets used by specific teams.
Provides quicker and easier access for analysis.

⚡ How is it connected?
Connected directly to the data warehouse and filters only relevant data.

6️⃣ BI Tools and Dashboards
📌 What is it?
Tools that help analyze and visualize data (e.g., Power BI, Tableau).

🌟 How is it used?
Creates graphs, reports, and interactive dashboards.

🔗 How is it connected?
Connects directly to the data warehouse or data marts to load data.

🔗 How is everything structured together?

Data Sources → send raw data to → ETL Process.
ETL Process → cleans and moves data to → Staging Area.
Staging Area → forwards data to → Data Warehouse.
Data Warehouse → splits into → Data Marts (if needed).
BI Tools → fetch data from Data Warehouse/Data Marts and create reports.
🖼️ Imagine a factory

Raw materials (data sources) are collected.
Processing (ETL) cleans and organizes the raw materials.
Storage (Data Warehouse) stores the finished products.
Stores (Data Marts) offer different products for different customers.
Showcases (BI Tools) display the products so customers can use them.
